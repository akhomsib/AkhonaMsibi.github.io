								<b>Tools:</b> Tableau

							<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0.1in;">
								This project explored life expectancy in the United States, and some of the factors that influence its fluctuations across the country. Several visualizations were developed in Tableau to analyze how location, demographics, prevalence of poverty, access to health insurance, and income inequality impacted life expectancy. For each of these factors, visual graphs were constructed to showcase these impacts and noteworthy information from the data in appealing and easily interpretable ways. Numerous visualization concepts were used to transform the time series and geospatial data into a meaningful graphical display for stakeholders. From this, users can identify national trends as well as state-level relationships with these factors.
							</p>
							<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0.1in;">
								In this analysis, it was shown that Southern states lagged in life expectancy over time. Additionally, life expectancy of the Black population remains significantly lower than that of other racial groups. The roughly even growth in income inequality across states, as well as expanded healthcare coverage through Medicaid, has had varying effects across the country. For example, states such as New York and California have experienced marginal life expectancy increases since the expansion of Medicaid, however, a state like Kentucky which has also experienced a growth in coverage has had a decrease in life expectancy during the same period.

								<h3>Achievements</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Discovered national trends and state-level impacts of indicators such as demographics, and access to healthcare on life expectancy, using temporal and geo-spatial data to create engaging visualizations and dashboards.</li>
									<li>Identified lagging life expectancy in Southern states despite roughly even increases in income inequality across the country, employing a time-lapsed symbol choropleth map to visually display these progressions over time.</li>
